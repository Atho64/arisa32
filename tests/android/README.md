# Android library and save-archive checks

These checks need a Java 11+ JDK and no Android device or Android runtime.
Compile the two platform-independent helpers together with the harness:

```sh
javac -encoding UTF-8 -d build/java-check \
  android/app/src/main/java/org/dc4engine/GameLibrary.java \
  android/app/src/main/java/org/dc4engine/SaveArchive.java \
  tests/android/LibraryChecks.java
java -cp build/java-check org.dc4engine.LibraryChecks
```

The harness creates isolated temporary data, then checks portable archive round
trips, rejection of malicious or damaged ZIP/save/profile records, preservation
of existing data on failures and old archives, interrupted-import recovery,
and catalogue fingerprint/persistence behavior. It removes only its temporary
root after execution. A successful run reports 60 checks.

The generated save records have valid emulator envelopes/checksums; complete
VM/resource restoration is tested by the C++ `scene_test` target. Android UI,
document-provider permissions, fonts and lifecycle still require device tests.
